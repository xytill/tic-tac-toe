  <h2 style="text-align: center;">What is iteration?</h2> 
  <p>Computers are known for their ability to do things which people consider to be boring and energy-consuming. For example, repeating identical tasks without any errors is one of these things. In Python, the process of repetitive execution of the same block of code is called an <strong>iteration</strong>.</p> 
  <p>There are two types of iteration:</p> 
  <p><strong>Definite iteration</strong>, where the number of repetitions is stated in advance.</p> 
  <p><strong>Indefinite iteration</strong>, where the code block executes as long as the condition stated in advance is true.</p> 
  <p>After the first iteration, the program comes back to the beginning of the code’s body and repeats it, making the so-called <strong>loop</strong>. The most used one is the <code class="language-python">for</code><strong> loop, </strong>named after the <code class="language-python">for</code><strong> operator</strong> that provides the code’s execution.</p> 
  <h2 style="text-align: center;">For loop syntax</h2> 
  <p>Here is the scheme of the loop:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">for variable in iterable:
    statement</code></pre> 
  <p>where <strong>statement</strong> is a block of operations executed for each item in<strong> iterable, </strong>an object used in iteration (e.g. string or list). Variable takes the value of the next iterable after each iteration.</p> 
  <p>Now try to guess which output we'll get if we execute the following piece of code:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">oceans = ['Atlantic', 'Pacific', 'Indian', 'Southern', 'Arctic']
for ocean in oceans:
    print(ocean)</code></pre> 
  <p>During each iteration the program will take the items from the list and execute the statements with them, so the output will be:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">Atlantic
Pacific
Indian
Southern
Arctic</code></pre> 
  <p>Even strings are iterable, so you can spell the word, for example:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">for char in 'magic':
    print(char)</code></pre> 
  <p> Like this:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">m
a
g
i
c</code></pre> 
  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Range function</h2> 
  <p>The <code class="language-python">range()</code><strong> function</strong> is used to specify the number of iterations. It returns a sequence of numbers from 0 (by default) and ends at a specified number. Be careful: the last number won’t be in the output.</p> 
  <p>Let's look at the example below:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">for i in range(5):
    print(i)</code></pre> 
  <p>What we'll get is this: </p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">0
1
2
3
4</code></pre> 
  <p>You can change the <strong>starting value</strong> if you’re not satisfied with 0, moreover, you can configure the <strong>increment (step)</strong> value by adding a third parameter:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">for i in range(5, 45, 10):
    print(i)</code></pre> 
  <p>According to the parameters included, we’ve asked to print the numbers from 5 to 45 with an increment value of 10. Be careful again, the last value is not included in the output:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">5
15
25
35</code></pre> 
  <p>If you're not going to use the counter variable in your loop, you can show it by replacing its name with an underscore symbol:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">for _ in range(100):
    do_smth()</code></pre> 
  <p>In the example above, we don't need the counter variable in any way, we simply use the loop to repeat <code class="language-python">do_smth()</code> function a given amount of times. </p> 
  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Input data processing </h2> 
  <p>You can also use the <code class="language-python">input()</code><strong> function </strong>that helps a user to pass a value to some variable and work with it. Thus, you can get the same output as with the previous piece of code:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">word = input()
for char in word:
    print(char)</code></pre> 
  <p>Oh, look, you can write a piece of code with a practical purpose:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">times = int(input('How many times should I say "Hello"?'))
for i in range(times):
    print('Hello!')</code></pre> 
  <p>You can, therefore, ask a user to specify the number of iterations to be performed.</p> 
  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Nested loop</h2> 
  <p>In Python, it is easy to put one loop inside another one – a <strong>nested loop</strong>. The type of inner and outer loops doesn't matter, the first to execute is the outer loop, then the inner one executes:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">names = ['Rose', 'Daniel']
surnames = ['Miller']
for name in names:
    for surname in surnames:
         print(name, surname)</code></pre> 
  <p>The output is shown below: </p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">Rose Miller
Daniel Miller</code></pre> 
  <p>In this example, we use the two <code class="language-python">for</code> loops to create fictional people's names. Obviously, you can deal with iterable objects of different sizes without too much fuss.</p> 
  <h2 style="text-align: center;">To sum up</h2> 
  <p>All in all, <code class="language-python">for</code> loops are an efficient way to automatize some repetitive actions. You can add variables and operations to make a nested loop. Moreover, you can control the number of iterations with the help of the <code class="language-python">range()</code> function. Be careful with the syntax: an extra indent or lack of colon can cause a mistake!</p>
