  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Simple if-else</h2> 
  <p>An <strong>if-else statement</strong> is another type of conditional expressions in Python. It differs from an <strong>if statement</strong> by the presence of the additional keyword <code class="language-python">else</code>. The block of code that <code class="language-python">else</code> contains executes when the condition of your if statement does not hold (the Boolean value is <code class="language-python">False</code>). Since an else statement is an alternative for an if statement, only one block of code can be executed. Also, <code class="language-python">else</code> doesn't require any condition:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">if today == "holiday":
    print("Lucky you!")
else:
    print("Keep your chin up, then.")</code></pre> 
  <p>Note that the 4-space <strong>indentation</strong> rule applies here too.</p> 
  <p>As you may soon find out, programmers do like all sorts of shortcuts. For conditional expressions, there's a trick as well – you can write an if-else statement in one line. This is called a <strong>ternary operator </strong>and it looks like this:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">print("It’s a day now!" if sun else "It’s a night for sure!")</code></pre> 
  <p>Or, more generally:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">first_alternative if condition else second_alternative</code></pre> 
  <p>It's a matter of convenience, but remember that the code you create should still be readable.</p> 
  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Nested if-else</h2> 
  <p>It should be mentioned, that <code class="language-python">if-else</code> statements can be <strong>nested</strong> the same way as <code class="language-python">if</code> statements. An additional conditional expression may appear after the <code class="language-python">if</code> section as well as after the <code class="language-python">else</code> section. Once again, don't forget to indent properly:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">if x &lt; 100:
    print('x &lt; 100')
else:
    if x == 100:
        print('x = 100')
    else:
        print('x &gt; 100')
    print('This will be printed only because x &gt;= 100')</code></pre> 
  <p>Now you are ready not only to set conditions but also to consider different alternatives. Congratulations!</p>
